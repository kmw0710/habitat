### Motivation

While there are many applications that helps to enhance productivity, the most crucial tool is a good to-do list. However, most existing tools in the market lack accessbility and customizability. This application effectively aims to provide a to-do list based on the location with a customized theme on a mobile device. Through linking with facebook and google calendar features, you can share and compare your status with friends and have alerts throughout your daily activities.
